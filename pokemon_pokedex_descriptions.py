    675: "Although it possesses a violent temperament, it won’t put up with bullying. It uses the leaf in its mouth to sense the movements of its enemies.",
    676: "Trimming its fluffy fur not only makes it more elegant but also increases the swiftness of its movements.",
    677: "The organ that emits its intense psychic power is sheltered by its ears to keep power from leaking out.",

    692: "They knock down flying prey by firing compressed water from their massive claws like shooting a pistol.",
    693: "Their enormous claws launch cannonballs of water powerful enough to pierce tanker hulls.",

    729: "A skillful dancer, it creates a sequence of water balloons as it dances, and briskly bombards its enemies.",

    758: "For some reason, only females have been found. It creates a reverse harem of male Salandit that it lives with.",
    759: "Despite its adorable appearance, when it gets angry and flails about, its arms and legs could knock a pro wrestler sprawling.",
    760: "This immensely dangerous Pokémon possesses overwhelming physical strength. Its habitat is generally off-limits.",
    761: "A delectable aroma pours from its body. They are often swallowed whole by Toucannon lured by that wafting deliciousness.",
    762: "The sepals on its head developed to protect its body. These are quite hard, so even if pecked by bird Pokémon, this Pokémon is totally fine.",
    763: "Its long, striking legs aren’t just for show but to be used to kick with skill. In victory, it shows off by kicking the defeated, laughing boisterously.",
    764: "It attaches flowers to its highly nutritious vine. This revitalizes the flowers, and they give off an aromatic scent.",
    765: "Known for its extreme intelligence, this Pokémon will look down on inexperienced Trainers, so it’s best suited to veteran Trainers.",
    766: "They form groups of roughly 20 individuals. Their mutual bond is remarkable—they will never let down a comrade.",

    768: "With a flashing slash of its giant sharp claws, it cleaves seawater—or even air—right in two.",
    769: "Born from a sand mound playfully built by a child, this Pokémon embodies the grudges of the departed.",
    770: "Possessed people controlled by this Pokémon transformed its sand mound into a castle. As it evolved, its power to curse grew ever stronger.",
    771: "It lives in shallow seas, such as areas near a beach. It can eject its internal organs, which it uses to engulf its prey or battle enemies.",
    772: "The heavy control mask it wears suppresses its intrinsic capabilities. This Pokémon has some hidden special power.",
    773: "Its trust in its partner is what awakens it. This Pokémon is capable of changing its type, a flexibility that is well displayed in battle.",
    774: "Originally making its home in the ozone layer, it hurtles to the ground when the shell enclosing its body grows too heavy.",
    775: "It is born asleep, and it dies asleep. All its movements are apparently no more than the results of it tossing and turning in its dreams.",
    776: "The shell on its back is chemically unstable and explodes violently if struck. The hole in its stomach is its weak point.",

    783: "It leaps at its prey with a courageous shout. Its scaly punches tear its opponents to shreds.",

    800: "Reminiscent of the Ultra Beasts, this life-form, apparently asleep underground, is thought to have come from another world in ancient times.",
    801: "This artificial Pokémon, constructed more than 500 years ago, can understand human speech but cannot itself speak.",
    802: "Able to conceal itself in shadows, it never appears before humans, so its very existence was the stuff of myth.",
    803: "This Ultra Beast is well enough liked to be chosen as a first partner in its own world.",
    804: "It stores hundreds of liters of poisonous liquid inside its body. It is one of the organisms known as UBs.",

    811: "The faster a Thwackey can beat out a rhythm with its two sticks, the more respect it wins from its peers.",

    827: "Aided by the soft pads on its feet, it silently raids the food stores of other Pokémon. It survives off its ill-gotten gains.",

    829: "It anchors itself in the ground with its single leg, then basks in the sun. After absorbing enough sunlight, its petals spread as it blooms brilliantly.",
    830: "The seeds attached to its cotton fluff are full of nutrients. It spreads them on the wind so that plants and other Pokémon can benefit from them.",
    831: "Its curly fleece is such an effective cushion that this Pokémon could fall off a cliff and stand right back up at the bottom, unharmed.",

    841: "It ate a sour apple, and that induced its evolution. In its cheeks, it stores an acid capable of causing chemical burns.",
    842: "Eating a sweet apple caused its evolution. A nectarous scent wafts from its body, luring in the bug Pokémon it preys on.",

    844: "When it contracts its body, over 220 pounds of sand sprays from its nose. If it ever runs out of sand, it becomes disheartened.",

    858: "It emits psychic power strong enough to cause headaches as a deterrent to the approach of others.",

    880: "In ancient times, it was unbeatable thanks to its powerful lower body, but it went extinct anyway after it depleted all its plant-based food sources.",
    881: "The shaking of its freezing upper half is what generates its electricity. It has a hard time walking around.",
    882: "Powerful legs and jaws made it the apex predator of its time. Its own overhunting of its prey was what drove it to extinction.",

    884: "Its body resembles polished metal, and it’s both lightweight and strong. The only drawback is that it rusts easily.",
